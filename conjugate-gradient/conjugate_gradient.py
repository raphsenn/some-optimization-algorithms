Conjugate Gradient Method for Solving Linear Systems

Consider the linear system Ax = b given by:

    A x = [ 4 1 ] [ x1 ] = [ 1 ] 
          [ 1 3 ] [ x2 ]   [ 2 ] 

where A is a 2x2 matrix, x is the solution vector, and b is the right-hand side vector.

We will perform the Conjugate Gradient Method, starting with an initial guess:

    x_0 = [ 2 ] 
          [ 1 ]

to find an approximate solution to the system.

Usage:
- Define the matrix A, right-hand side vector b, and an initial guess x_0.
- Call the conjugate_gradient_method function with the initial guess, b, and the maximum number of iterations.
- The function will iteratively approximate the solution and display a plot showing the progress.

Example:
    b = np.array([1, 2])
    x_0 = np.array([2, 1])
    print(conjugate_gradient_method(x_0, b, max_iterations=10))
